## Part1
- part1:  
By observing the examples given by the major project, I found inspiration for my imaging technique:  
I was inspired by the works of fireworks artist **Cai Guo-Qiang**, **Memories** and **Flora on Porcelain**, which create paintings through exploding gunpowder.   
I want to combine the randomness of his works and the **explosion effect** of fireworks with the colors of my works.   
The color presented through the explosion effect can make the subsequent animation better interact with the audience.

## Part2
- part2:  
Written in **JavaScript**, WebGL implements the simulation and rendering of a particle system, combining the two libraries **WebGL** and **Olon**.  
This coding technique uses WebGL and shader programming to simulate the fireworks art effect of Cai Guoqiang's works.  
By controlling the properties of the particle **position**, **speed**, and **appearance time**, and adjusting the transparency, it can create a visual color explosion effect, which is better interactivity when combined with our works.
